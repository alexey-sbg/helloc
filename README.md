# Hello C, just an hello world example

This is a super small c example where a single file gets compiled on the 
Docker image and then imported on the platform.

The application will act as a filter for lines starting with ## if input and output files are specified.

Check the `Dockerfile` to see how to compile a C program and add it to the path.
